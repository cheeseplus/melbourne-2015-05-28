Note: 
Started very young - Dad is a massive nerd and we had computers in the home early
Dad was also into robotics and amateur rocketry so I was encouraged very young
He was a stay at home dad as well - He is awesome
We were a military family so we moved around a lot, as such the internet kept us connected to families/friends
I was writing Basic games on a Commodore64 at the age of 8
"You'll never make any money playing video games" -> 14 years later I won the bet

### Strong Opinions
#### <span style="color:#42affa">Or how I learned to stop worrying and love Illumos</span>

* ZFS is the best file system
* DTrace is the best system tracing tool
* SMF is the best service init/manager
* We owe Sun a ton for doing amazing R&D <3
* Brendan Gregg is a wizard

---

### Strong Opinions
#### <span style="color:#42affa">Humans are more important than computers</span>

* Empathy Driven Development 
* Community > Technical Perfection
* Use the right tool for the right job
* Examine all assumptions critically
* Fundamentals are IMPORTANT
* Telemetry > Measuring everything
* Remember that humans make software. They have feelings.

Note:
Empathy and community is one of the biggest reasons I started using Chef
It's also why I work here
Inspirations for growing knowledge:
Brendan Gregg (Joyent, Netflix), Theo Schlossnagle (OmniTI), Scott Fritchie, 
a dozen (ex) Bashos, Kyle Kingsbury, Camille Fournier, Adam Jacob, Noah Kantrowitz,
Miah Johnson, Matt Suave-Frankel, Joshua Timberman, and dozens of others

### Why?

If you are writing a cookbook you want to test it before putting it into production. Test-kitchen provides a framework that, in conjunction with the tools I will describe, helps enable test driven development (TDD)

---

#### Test Kitchen allows one to

* creation of compute resources for multiple platforms (concurrently)
* converge cookbooks based on platform + suite defintions
* integration test the created compute resources
* destroy compute resources when done

---

#### Platform configuration


<span style="color:#42affa">.kitchen.yml</span>
```yaml
platforms:
  - name: ubuntu-14.04
  - name: centos-7.0
  - name: centos-6.6
```

---

#### Driver configuration

<span style="color:#42affa">.kitchen.yml</span>

```yaml
---
driver:
  name: vagrant
  network:
    - ["private_network", {ip: "192.168.11.333"}]

provisioner:
  name: chef_zero
  chef_version: 12.3.0
```

---

#### Driver configuration (cloud)

<span style="color:#42affa">.kitchen.cloud.yml</span>

<span style="color:#42affa">export KITCHEN_YAML=.kitchen.$WHATEVS.yml</span>

```yaml
---
driver:
  name: ec2
  aws_access_key_id: <%= ENV["AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"] %>
  aws_secret_access_key: <%= ENV["AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"] %>
  aws_ssh_key_id: <%= ENV["AWS_KEYPAIR_NAME"] %>

platforms:
- name: amazon-2014.03.1
  driver:
    image_id: ami-ed8e9284
    username: ec2-user
    ssh_key: <%= ENV["EC2_SSH_KEY_PATH"] %>
 ```

---

### Suite configuration

```yaml
suites:
  - name: coprhd-host-add
    run_list:
      - recipe[coprhd_host_test::add]
    attributes:
      coprhd:
        user: <%= ENV['VIPR_USER'] %>
        password:  <%= ENV['VIPR_PASS'] %>
        url: <%= ENV['VIPR_URL'] %>
        host:
          type: 'Linux'
          ip_or_dns: '192.168.10.111'
          user_name: 'root'
          password:  'password'
```

* A linter and style tool for cookbooks


---

#### [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop)

* A Ruby static code analyzer
* Based on [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide)

---

### Rubocop configuration


<span style="color:#42affa">.rubocop.yml</span>
```yaml
suites:
  - name: coprhd-host-add
    run_list:
      - recipe[coprhd_host_test::add]
    attributes:
      coprhd:
        user: <%= ENV['VIPR_USER'] %>
        password:  <%= ENV['VIPR_PASS'] %>
        url: <%= ENV['VIPR_URL'] %>
        host:
          type: 'Linux'
          ip_or_dns: '192.168.10.111'
          user_name: 'root'
          password:  'password'
```

---

### [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/)

* Continous testing and deployment
* Free for Open Source projects
* Integrates with GitHub [pull requests](https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/mysql/pull/343)

Note:
Who all uses TravisCI?

---

#### TravisCI Configuration


<span style="color:#42affa">.travis.yml</span>
```yaml
language: ruby
bundler_args: --without kitchen_vagrant
rvm:
- 2.1.0
script:
- rake spec
```

---

#### Rake
##### Alternative - Thor

<span style="color:#42affa">Rakefile</span>
```ruby
# Rspec and ChefSpec
desc 'Run ChefSpec examples'
RSpec::Core::RakeTask.new(:spec)

# Integration tests. Kitchen.ci
namespace :integration do
  desc 'Run Test Kitchen with Vagrant'
  task :vagrant do
    Kitchen.logger = Kitchen.default_file_logger
    Kitchen::Config.new.instances.each do |instance|
      instance.test(:always)
    end
  end
```

---

#### Guardfile
##### <span style="color:#42affa">Extra Credit</span>

```ruby
guard 'rubocop' do
  watch(/attributes\/.+\.rb$/)
  watch(/providers\/.+\.rb$/)
  watch(/recipes\/.+\.rb$/)
  watch(/resources\/.+\.rb$/)
  watch('metadata.rb')
end
```

Note:
Guard is just a filesystem event notifier with plugins
Extreme TDD
Every file save it can trigger actions

---

```
kitchen create REGEX
```

##### Just creates the compute resource

---

```
kitchen converge REGEX
```

1. Creates compute resource (if not created already)
2. Installs Chef (if not created already)
3. Converges cookbooks
4. Leaves compute resource running

---

```
kitchen verify REGEX
```

1. Creates compute resource (if not created already)
2. Installs Chef (if not created already)
3. Converges cookbooks (if not created already)
3. Runs integrations test
  * ServerSpec
  * Rspec
  * BATS
4. Leaves compute resource running

---

```
kitchen test REGEX
```
##### Does ALL THE THINGS

1. Creates compute resource (if not created already)
2. Installs Chef
3. Converges cookbooks
4. Runs integration tests 
5. Destroys compute resource if test pass (default)

---

```
kitchen test -c N REGEX
```
Does <span style="color:#42affa">N</span> number of actions concurrently

---

#### More than just servers

* On the partner engineering team we do many integrations
* Chef is for more than just servers
* Integrations with
  * Citrix Netscalers
  * F5 BigIP
  * VMware vCloud Air
  * EMC CoprHD (ViPR Controller)

---

#### EMC CoprHD (formerly ViPR Controller)
<span style="color:#42affa">(as an example)</span>

* Software defined storage
* Discovers all devices on your network
* Seamless managemnet of heterogenous resources
  * EMC VNX Block
  * ScaleIO
  * Lots [more](http://www.emc.com/techpubs/vipr/what_is_virtual_pool-3.htm)
* Open Source at EMC World 2015 
  * Code available in June
* Great [API Documentation](http://www.emc.com/techpubs/api/vipr/v2-2-0-4/index.htm)

---

#### Fixture Cookbooks
##### Cookbooks to test your (resource) cookbooks 

<span style="color:#42affa">Berksfile</span>
```ruby
source "https://supermarket.chef.io"

metadata

cookbook 'coprhd_host_test', path: 'test/fixtures/cookbooks/coprhd_host_test'
cookbook 'coprhd_vcenter_test', path: 'test/fixtures/cookbooks/coprhd_vcenter_test'
```
